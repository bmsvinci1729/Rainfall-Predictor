#### Hi all,
As a final project of the ML with Python course, here I present another data science project.<br />
⛈️ Australia Rainfall prediction model. <br />
Trained KNN, SVM, Logistic Regressor, and Decision Tree with the dataset, and compared the accuracy in their predictions.
SVM topped in the accuracy with an impressive score of **84.44%**
